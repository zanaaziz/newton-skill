# What is this?
Newton is an Alexa skill that connects to an open API in order to solve various algebraic mathematical expressions when asked
for by the user.

# How Does It Work?
- 1.) Ask Newton a mathematical expression you'd like the answer to.
- 2.) Newton will listen and connect to an API which takes in the mathematical expression and responds with its result.
- 3.) Alexa calls out the result to you.
