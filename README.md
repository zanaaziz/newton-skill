# newton-alexa-skill-api
An Alexa skill that connects to an API in order to solve various algebraic mathematical expressions when asked for by the user.

# How Does It Work?
- 1.) Ask Newton a mathematical expression you'd like the answer to.
- 2.) Newton will listen and connect to an API which takes in the mathematical expression and responds with its result.
- 3.) Alexa then calls out the result for you.

# Where's the API?
Credits go to Gerald Nash (aunyks) for the API to make this possible on https://newton.now.sh. Amazing work!

# Newton 1.0
The first working edition of Newton with the capability of solving basic differentiation and logarithmic problems.
In this version, Newton has the capability of solving simple differential and logarithmic problems.

Differentiation Example:
- User: "What's the derivative of x to the power of seven?" [x^7]
- Newton: "The answer is six x to the power of six" [6x^6]

Logarithmic Example:
- User: "What's the log of eight to the base of two?" [log2(8)]
- Newton: "The answer is three." [3]
