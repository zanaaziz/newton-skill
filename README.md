# What is this?
Newton is an Alexa skill that connects to an open API in order to solve various algebraic mathematical expressions when asked
for by the user.

# How Does It Work?
- 1.) Ask Newton a mathematical expression you'd like the answer to.
- 2.) Newton will listen and connect to an API which takes in the mathematical expression and responds with its result.
- 3.) Alexa calls out the result to you.

# Newton 1.0
The first working edition of Newton with the capability of solving basic differentiation and logarithmic problems.

Differentiation Example:

- User: "What's the derivative of two x to the power of seven?" [2x^7]
- Newton: "The answer is fourteen x to the power of six" [14x^6]

Logarithmic Example:
- User: "What's the log of eight to the base of two?" [log2(8)]
- Newton: "The answer is three." [3]

# Newton 1.1
Following upon the first version, 1.1 adds the ability to solve more complex differentiation problems.

Example:
- User: "Derive two x to the power of nine plus x to the power of seven?" [2x^9+x^7]
- Newton: "The answer is eighteen x to the power of eight plus seven x to the power of six." [18x^8+7x^6]
